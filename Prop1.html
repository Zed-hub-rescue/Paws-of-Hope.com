    <p>Rescue and Feeding for Street Cats in Bangalore</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a passionate group of students from Bangalore trying to protect and save stray cats from hunger and predator attacks. Our goal is to provide them safe shelter, medical care, and a second chance at life.</p>

    <h2>Why Support Us?</h2>
    <p><strong>"Why should we donate or support you? There are already so many established organizations doing this on a larger scale."</strong></p>
    <p>That’s a truly valid question, and we welcome it. We’re a small but committed group of students who started this with zero funding and just one shared emotion — empathy. While we respect larger organizations, we’ve personally witnessed troubling incidents where rescued cats were later sold, and donation funds were misused. Our work is raw, honest, and from the heart. Even a single rupee, a tip, or a small bag of food can save a life. Be part of the change they forgot to be.</p>
